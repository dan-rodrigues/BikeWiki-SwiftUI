The standard 1200 Thruxton has conventional cartridge forks and fixed discs, while the \"R\" has upgraded Öhlins rear suspension with Showa USD \"big piston\" forks and Brembo front radial calipers with floating discs. Both 1200 Thruxtons have traction control, ABS, and ride by wire throttles featuring three modes, sport, road, and rain.",
