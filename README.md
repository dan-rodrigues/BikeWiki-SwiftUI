# BikeWiki-SwiftUI

This is a minimal SwiftUI / Combine demo app. The goal is to provide a basic UI with less emphasis on visuals and more on using Combine to drive a SwiftUI app with little to no imperative code.

## Prerequisites

* Xcode 12 or newer
* iOS14 or newer simulator or device

## TODO

* More functional and snapshot tests
* Improved layout for `.regular` size classes
* Additional features assuming they actually exercise new Combine functionality
* Better documentation
